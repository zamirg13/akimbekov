        <h3>Blog Post 1: Introduction to McKinsey-like Problem Solving</h3>
        <p>Imagine you're a detective, trying to solve a mystery. That's what problem solving is like. Just like a detective, we follow a process. McKinsey-like problem solving has seven steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Problem Definition:</b> Like understanding what mystery we're trying to solve. Let's say our bicycle is broken.</li>
            <li><b>Problem Structuring:</b> We divide our main problem into smaller, easier to handle problems. Like figuring out if the issue with the bicycle is with the chain, the tires, or the brakes.</li>
            <li><b>Prioritization:</b> We focus on the most important smaller problems first. Maybe the tires are flat, so we decide to fix them before anything else.</li>
            <li><b>Issue Analysis:</b> We dig deeper into our priority problems. Why are the tires flat? Did they get punctured?</li>
            <li><b>Synthesis:</b> We bring together all the information we've collected. We've learned the tires are flat because they were punctured by a nail.</li>
            <li><b>Storylining:</b> We create a story out of our findings. "The bicycle was not working because the tires were punctured by a nail."</li>
            <li><b>Communication:</b> We share our story and solution with others. "I found a nail punctured our bicycle's tires, so I fixed them."</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Just like a detective solves a mystery, we too can solve any problem following these steps. In our upcoming blogs, we will delve deeper into each step and learn how to apply them in our day-to-day life.</p>
